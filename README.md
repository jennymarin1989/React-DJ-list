# React-DJ-list

The main goal of this tech test is creating a simple application where the DJ can display a list of songs of a given year, making her life more easy during the session. Each song should be displayed with the Title, Artist, Album and year.

## Approach

My first approach to this challenge was a brainstorm of ideas, creating user stories using the domain model as a guide to fulfil all the user requirements.

Initially my idea was to build a full stack app using the MERN stack applying TDD principles but It will take more than one day to finish it, so I made the decision to use React, Axios, Json and jest as a testing framework.


## User stories

```
As a DJ
So I can succesfully run my session
I want to be able to **use** the React-DJ-List app

As a DJ
So I can **view** a specific list of songs
I want to be able to display a list of songs of a given year

As a DJ
So I can have more information about the list I'm playing
I want to be able to get the Title, Artist, Album and Year

As a new User
So I can make an effective use of the app
I wan to be able to have all the instructions about the use of the app
